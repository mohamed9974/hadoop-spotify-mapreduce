## About <a name = "about"></a>

    []: # Apache Hadoop’s MapReduce

    Apache Hadoop’s MapReduce is a framework for distributed processing of large data sets.
    It is a Java implementation of the MapReduce algorithm.
    It is a distributed processing framework that allows you to write MapReduce programs
    in Java.
    you will use Apache Hadoop’s MapReduce to get insights from the Top Hits
    from Spotify 2000-2019 dataset.

    []: # Tasks
    • List the total duration (ms) of each song in the dataset (total)
    • List the average duration (ms) of each song (average)
    • List how many times an artist has been in the top hits list (popular)
    • Separate the songs according to whether they are explicit or not, then list the average popularity 
        for the songs in those two separate categories. Output explicit songs in part-r-00000 
        and non-explicit songs in part-r-00001 (explicitlypopular)
    • Partition the songs by year; first partition is the songs that came out on or before 2002
        (year ≤ 2002), the second partition is for songs that came out between 2002 and 2012
        (2002 < year ≤ 2012) and final partition is the songs that came out later than 2012
        (2012 < year). Report the average danceability of these 3 partitions (part-r-00000 to
        part-r-00002). (dancebyyear).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

    []: # Getting Started
    After cloning the project, you can run the following commands to get started:
    ./install.sh
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

    []: # Prerequisites
    1. Install Java 8
    2. Install Maven
```
Give examples

    []: # Prerequisites
    1. sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    2. sudo apt-get install maven
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
